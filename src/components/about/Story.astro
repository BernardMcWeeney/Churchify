          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Churchify.ie was founded in 2020 with a simple mission: to help parishes across Ireland embrace the digital age without compromising their traditions or values.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">We recognized that many parishes were struggling to maintain connection with their communities, especially during challenging times when in-person attendance was limited. Our team of dedicated professionals combined their expertise in web development, digital communications, and parish administration to create tailored solutions for the unique needs of religious communities.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">Today, we're proud to have helped dozens of parishes transform their digital presence, increase their outreach, and streamline their operations. Our commitment to affordability, reliability, and excellent service has made us the trusted digital partner for parishes of all sizes throughout Ireland.</p>
